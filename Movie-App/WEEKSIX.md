So for week five I put Coroutines into my project. So I think I'm going to have to focus on the 'extra-credit' this week.

- Using launch() and different Dispatchers
- [ ] Removed allowMainThreadQueries call
- [ ] Kotlin Coroutines Support
- [ ] Implemented the LifecycleScope from Android Jetpack Lifecycle Components
- [ ] Launch functions to start coroutines
- [ ] Different dispatchers and switching from Main to BG or vice-versa
- [ ] DON'T USE GLOBAL SCOPE!!

- Extra Credit
- [ ] Custom CoroutineScope
- [ ] Read Room w/ Kotlin Coroutines support
- [ ] Using Flow API for reactive implementation of the Room Database
