So for week five I put Coroutines into my project. So I think I'm going to have to focus on the 'extra-credit' this week.

- Using launch() and different Dispatchers
- [x] Removed allowMainThreadQueries call
- [x] Kotlin Coroutines Support
- [x] Implemented the LifecycleScope from Android Jetpack Lifecycle Components
- [x] Launch functions to start coroutines
- [?] Different dispatchers and switching from Main to BG or vice-versa
- [x] DON'T USE GLOBAL SCOPE!!

- Extra Credit
- [ ] Custom CoroutineScope
- [x] Read Room w/ Kotlin Coroutines support
- [ ] Using Flow API for reactive implementation of the Room Database
