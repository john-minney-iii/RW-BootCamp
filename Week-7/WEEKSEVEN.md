I probably could have added to my current project, but in the assignment description said to not use a Movie API. So I figured it would probably be best to just start from scratch.

- Grading Criteria
	- Successfully retrieve data from an API
	- Successfully store that data locally in your app using Room
	- present that data using a recycler view
	- Include images as part of that presentation
		(Use Glide?)
